# Note

I tried to design a single page website and that's why I do not have multiple html pages. I haved included everything in index.html.

Oct 1 submission note,

For the wow feature, I was supposed to add a parallax effect to the website. However, after implementing it I realized it didnâ€™t suit the current design, so I explored other options and ultimately added a Typed.js effect instead. In addition, I fixed several scrolling bugs and added a footer and a logo.
